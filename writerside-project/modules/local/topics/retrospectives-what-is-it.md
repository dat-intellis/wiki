## Anti Patterns
Reflecting on common mistakes in retrospectives is crucial for continuous improvement. Here are some pitfalls to watch out for. Avoiding these mistakes ensures more effective retrospectives and better team dynamics.

1. **Skipping Retrospectives**:
   - **Mistake**: Neglecting retrospectives due to time constraints or lack of perceived value.
   - **Impact**: Missed opportunities for learning and growth.
   - **Solution**: Prioritize retrospectives as a regular part of the sprint cycle.

1. **Rushing Through the Retrospective**:
   - **Mistake**: Conducting retrospectives hastily without allowing sufficient time for meaningful discussions.
   - **Impact**: Superficial insights and missed chances for improvement.
   - **Solution**: Allocate dedicated time and prioritize retrospectives.

1. **Using the Same Format Every Time**:
   - **Mistake**: Sticking rigidly to a single retrospective format.
   - **Impact**: Boredom and diminishing engagement.
   - **Solution**: Experiment with different techniques (e.g., Start-Stop-Continue, 4Ls, or Sailboat) to keep it fresh.
