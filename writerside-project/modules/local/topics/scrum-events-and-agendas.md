# Scrum Event Agenda's

This page contains Agenda's, and Notes, regarding scrum events.

## Event Consistency {collapsible="true"}
It is worth it to consider gathering all sprint related events on the same day of the week, for the following 
advantages: 
1. It will make it easier to remember when each event is scheduled.
2. It will increase the flexibility of the team to schedule other events on other days.
3. It will increase the flexibility for flex times and remote work.
4. It will increase the likelihood of having POs and SMs available for all sprint events.
   - Maybe even physically present in the same location.


## Backlog Refinement {collapsible="true"}

**Duration**: 2-4 Hours at two-week sprints.

**Purpose**: Backlog Refinement is an ongoing process in Scrum where the Product Owner and the Development Team review items on the Product Backlog to ensure they are appropriate, detailed, and estimated. The aim is to keep the Product Backlog updated, prioritized, and ready for future Sprints.

**Outcome**: At the end of the Backlog Refinement process, the Product Backlog items (PBIs) should be well-understood, appropriately sized, and prioritized by the team. This ensures that the team is ready to go into the Sprint Planning meeting with a clear understanding of what to work on next.

**Checklist**

1. **Preparation**
    - Ensure the Product Backlog is populated with PBIs.
    - Review the Definition of Ready (DoR).
    - Review the team's velocity and capacity.

2. **Backlog Review**
    - Go through the Product Backlog items one by one.
    - Discuss the details, requirements, and value of each PBI with the Product Owner.
    - Identify any dependencies, risks, or blockers.

3. **Estimation**
    - For each PBI, discuss the effort required to complete it.
    - Use an estimation technique (like Planning Poker) to estimate the size of each PBI.

4. **Prioritization**
    - The Product Owner prioritizes the PBIs based on their value, risk, and dependencies.
    - Discuss and agree on the priority with the team.

5. **Conclusion**
    - Review the updated Product Backlog.
    - Ensure a shared understanding of the PBIs and their priority.
    - Plan for the next Backlog Refinement session.

Remember, Backlog Refinement is not a one-time event but a continuous process to keep the Product Backlog updated and ready for the next Sprint. It helps in making the Sprint Planning more efficient and effective. Happy refining! ðŸ˜Š.


## Sprint Planning {collapsible="true"}

**Duration**: 2-4 hours at two-week sprints.

**Purpose**: The Sprint Planning Meeting is a collaborative event in Scrum where the entire Scrum Team comes together to lay out the groundwork for the upcoming Sprint.

## Q&A {collapsible="true"}

### What is a Sprint Goal? 
A good Sprint Goal is a concise statement that describes the purpose of the Sprint and provides a clear direction for the team. It should be:

1. **Specific**: Clearly defines what the team wants to achieve.
2. **Measurable**: Allows the team to know when the goal has been met.
3. **Achievable**: Can realistically be completed within the Sprint.
4. **Relevant**: Aligns with the team's mission and the product's roadmap.
5. **Time-bound**: Can be completed within the Sprint's timeframe.

Here are a few examples of good Sprint Goals:

1. **Improve Checkout Process**: Enhance the user experience in the checkout process to reduce cart abandonment by 20%.
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure that all pages of our website are fully responsive on mobile devices.
3. **Increase Test Coverage**: Increase unit test coverage for the backend code from 70% to 85%.
4. **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure that all our services are GDPR compliant.

Remember, a good Sprint Goal gives the team a shared objective and helps them stay focused and aligned throughout the Sprint. ðŸ˜Š
